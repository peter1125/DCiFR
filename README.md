DCiFR is a wrapper software allows you to run deep learning models to parse demographic characteristics from a picture. This open-source wrapper software written in Python has a GUI that will allow you to run complex models without any knowledge of coding. This includes functions from [deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) and is built with [PyQT5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) to provide the GUI.
